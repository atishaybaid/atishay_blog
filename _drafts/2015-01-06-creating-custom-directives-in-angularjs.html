<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today i will write a post on the topic which i recently learnt and found very useful.We are going to discuss about creating our own directives.<br />Directives are core feature behind any Angularjs App.So they are the elements which adds extra power &nbsp;to HTML elements.<br />Now why there is a need to create custom directive,Although every DOM mainpulation &nbsp;can be done in the controller itself.But it hinders the main concern of angularjs that is separation of concern. &nbsp;</div>
